# i2hdify - a simple ffmpeg script

## How do i run this?
depending on your platform, enter one of the folders, then run either stream for a udp stream or video for a mp4 file named
"input" EXACTLY

## What does this simulate?
It simulates both the nielsen watermarking and hd output cards from the IntelliStar 2 HD by giving the
saturated look of the thunderstorm card, and the audio from the nielsen card. this was written as a quick
thing for people with i2's or simulators can use to help give off a realistic early 2010's i2 era look and feel.
